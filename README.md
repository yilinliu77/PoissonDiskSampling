# Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in C++

This is my implementation of "Efficient and flexible sampling with blue noise properties of triangular meshes".

# Usage

- Install `CGAL`, `glog`, and `Eigen` library
- Modify the `mesh_file` and `number_of_sample_on_triangle_mesh` variable in the `main.cpp` and run the code.
- The output will be in the working derectory.
